# CV

Eventually I hope to have a more complete system for organizing and deploying a CV and biosketch for academic purposes. Right now it is just a LaTeX template for the [UNL COE CV Word template](https://engineering.unl.edu/employee-resources-promotion-and-tenure/).

# Current status

(Rough) LaTeX template for the prescribed UNL COE CV Word template. I hope to make a full LaTeX document class in the near future. Instructions are found in the files themselves.

Here is a [completed example](http://cse.unl.edu/~jbradley/cv/justin_bradley_cv.pdf).
