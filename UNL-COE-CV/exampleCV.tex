% Date: Sunday, October 02, 2016
% Description: Curriculum Vitae for COE at UNL
%
% Changes:
% 2020-10: Update to latest version of COE CV template. Add nice comments and
% instructions for others to use the template.
% 2023-01:
%    * Added support for reverse ordering journals, conferences,
%      grants, and books.
%    * Added support for listing books
%    * Cleaned up preamble_CV.inc and added better documentation throughout
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Instructions:
% 1. Fill in values just below
% 2. Choose your tags, or just delete them if you like. I use tags so that I can
% remove/add some things for internal vs. external consumption (e.g., SAP WBS
% numbers)
% 3. Populate a bibtex file with your publications. Cite your publications like
% normal in the appropriate sections (see examples below). Be sure to use $^1$
% etc. in the bibtex file to indicate your MS, PhD, or BS students as indicated by the template
% (see Section "Publication Record" below).

% NOTE: All the sections in this template are required by COE whether you have
% something that goes in the sections or not. So don't delete any sections,
% subsections, or subsubsections. The only exceptions are tagged/untagged that
% are for external use and are extensively commented below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% get the preamble
\input{preamble_CV.inc}

% Fill in these values:
\newcommand{\UNLname}{Sample Q. Example}
% this is your surname or another name that identifies you in an author list
% (used to bold your name in your publications assuming you use one my BST files)
\newcommand{\UNLcitename}{Bradley}
\newcommand{\UNLrank}{Associate Professor}
\newcommand{\UNLdept}{School of Computing}
\newcommand{\UNLphone}{(402) 472-0000}
\newcommand{\UNLaddress}{301 Schorr Center}
\newcommand{\UNLemail}{sampleqexample@unl.edu}
\newcommand{\UNLwebsite}{\url{your.website.com}}

% Tags that turn on and off certain pieces based on whether you are compiling
% the CV for internal, external, or COE/P&T use:
% INTERNAL - things that should be included when printed for in-house review
% currently:
% 1. Turns on unfunded grants
% 2. Turns on SAP WBS numbers

% PANDT - things that only go in, or removed when submitting for P&T
% currently:
% 1. turns on table indicating changes made
% 2. turns on grant summary tables in the "Grantsmanship Record"

% COE - things that get included, or removed for COE
% currently:
% 1. Turns off Teaching Accomplishments (in classroom)

% section 2.1
\subsection{Publication Record}

% NOTE 1:
% \pubaddendum takes one argument and bolds it. This is where you would put any
% notes about this publication (e.g., tier, impact factor, first author, etc.)
% Helpful functions are:
% \tier{1-3} yields properly typeset tier
% \cont{#} yields "contribution: #%"
% \accrate{#} yields "acceptance rate: #%"
% \impact{#} yields "impact: #"

% NOTE 2:
% For the publications, I use reverse ordered J# (e.g., J1, J2) for journals, and C# (e.g., C1,
% C2) for conferences. This lets me refer to them easily in a corresponding
% research statement. If this is undesired, you can use the list mybibenum
% rather than revjournalbib or revconferencebib. If you want ordered (as opposed
% to reverse ordered) lists use journalbib and conferencebib lists

% NOTE 3:
% To list publications I use a standard bibtex file (i.e., .bib), along with
% bibentry as seen below. This is handy and avoids having to manually enter
% publications. To get the bold author you'll need to use the
% bibliographystyle files from this repo (e.g., bst/IEEEtranDOI-boldAuthor) and
% modify \UNLcitename above.

\emph{
  The following subscripts are used to indicate student and other co-authors
  under my supervision:\\
  1: Undergraduate student\\
  2:  Masters student\\
  3: Ph.D. student\\
  4: Postdoctoral researcher\\
  \\% change/remove this note as needed
  \textbf{NOTE: In my publications I place myself as last author (organizing
    author) on
    papers with students, unless I did the super-majority of the work.}
