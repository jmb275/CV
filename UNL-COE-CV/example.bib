abstract = {Summary A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a collection of computing devices that communicate with each other, operate in the target environment via actuators and interact with the physical world through sensors in a feedback loop. CPSs need to be safe and reliable and function in accordance with their requirements. Testing, focusing on a CPS model and/or its code, is the primary approach used by engineers to achieve this. Generating, selecting and prioritizing test cases that can reveal faults in CPSs, from the wide range of possible input values and stimuli that affect their operation, are of central importance in this process. To date, however, in our search of the literature, we have found no comprehensive survey of research on test case generation, selection and prioritization for CPSs. In this article, therefore, we report the results of a survey of approaches for generating, selecting and prioritizing test cases for CPSs; the results illustrate the progress that has been made on these approaches to date, the properties that characterize the approaches and the challenges that remain open in these areas of research.}

  abstract={In this paper we develop four methods for proving stability for a subclass of co-regulated systems - finite-state, co-regulated systems with restrictions on possible sampling rates. "Co-regulation" is a control strategy we previously developed wherein cyber and physical effectors are dynamically adjusted in response to holistic system performance. The cyber effector, sampling rate, is adjusted in response to off-nominal conditions in the controlled system, and the physical effector adjusts control outputs corresponding to the current (changing) sampling rate. The resulting computer-control system is a discrete-time-varying system with changing zero-order holds and sampling periods, and unknown delays over discrete intervals. This makes performance guarantees such as stability difficult to obtain.We address this difficulty by drawing from specialized results in the control community to develop four methods for proving asymptotic stability of finite-state, co-regulated systems. Each successive method relaxes the assumptions needed to guarantee stability. This lays the groundwork for a more all-encompassing analytical framework for co-regulated systems. We use the results to demonstrate stability for a co-regulated multicopter unmanned aircraft system.},
